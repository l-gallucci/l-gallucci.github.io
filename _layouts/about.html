    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a <strong>microbial ecologist</strong> fascinated by how life thrives in extreme environments —
      particularly deep-sea hydrothermal vents. My research integrates omics, chemistry, and modeling
      to understand how microbes influence the cycling of iron, sulfur, and trace elements in hydrothermal plumes.

      Beyond research, I enjoy coding, designing games, and cooking — exploring creativity across both
      science and art.
