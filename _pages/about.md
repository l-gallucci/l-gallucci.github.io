<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
Iâ€™m a microbial ecologist working on hydrothermal vent systems, focusing on how trace metals shape microbial and viral communities.
</p>

<p>
At the <strong>Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology</strong>, I combine metagenomics, chemistry, and modeling
to understand the ecology of Sulfurimonas and SUP05 lineages.
</p>

<p>
Outside of science, I develop interactive pixel-art games and apps for science communication.
