<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a <strong>microbial ecologist</strong> fascinated by how life thrives in extreme environments —
  particularly deep-sea hydrothermal vents. My research integrates omics, chemistry, and modeling
  to understand how microbes influence the cycling of iron, sulfur, and trace elements in hydrothermal plumes.

  Beyond research, I enjoy coding, designing games, and cooking — exploring creativity across both
  science and art.
