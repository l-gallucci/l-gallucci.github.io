  <h1>Research</h1>
  <p>
    My research focuses on the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of deep-sea hydrothermal systems,
    combining multi-omics and geochemical modeling to understand how microbes influence the cycling of iron, sulfur, and trace elements in hydrothermal plumes.
    Throughout my academic journey, I have had the privilege of working with many inspiring researchers —
    some of whom became close friends and remarkable collaborators — leading to several exciting scientific partnerships, some of which are listed below.
